# Dynamo

### client
before everything go to the client folder open cmd and type npm run install

after you download the all the modules type npm run start for getting on the client


### server

the server is c# api based 

running ISS Express or API on https://localhost:44344/api on my local machine
so if you change the port you should also change the port on the client inside the Store.jsx file so the client can communicate with the server.
i didnt manage to dockerize the server because my machine has only 4gram and i could not run the docker desktop and test it
the methods inside the controller are easy to understand without any documentation . as database i use json file and i manipulate it with datalayer 
service implemented by me.



thnx for reading
